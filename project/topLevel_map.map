WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ALU_Bmux_sel<2> is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    23 out of   1,430    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         8 out of   2,860    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           74
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            24 out of      74   32%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              15 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
